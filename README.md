# CSGO-AGR-Import-Export-FBX (AIOX)
Addon for Blender to export the recorded AGR-File from HLAE to FBX files for UE4

## Features:
- imports .agr through afx-blender-scripts
- merging the Run-Animation and Ragdoll-Animation together in one model
- selects all keyframes available
- deletes Physics(everything with the name "physics" in it)
- renames the parent-object(afx.*) to root and exports it with its childrens as FBX
- exports afxCam as single FBX file
- convert whole csgo model-folders to FBX for UE4 (has currently a bug, which renames the parent-object to "root.001" and not "root", dont use it)
