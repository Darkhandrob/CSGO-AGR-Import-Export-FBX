# CSGO-AGR-Import-Export-FBX (AIOX)
This addon for Blender reduces the amount of work to import csgo's agr and export every model in it as a fbx,
so you can open it in Unreal Engine 4.
Also has a option to convert Apex Legends .smd models to fbx.

## Features:
- imports .agr(recorded animations with hlae)
- fixes "record invisible"-option through merging run-animations and ragdoll-animations together
- deletes useless physics for moviemaking
- exports every animation as .fbx
- converts decompiled models(.smd and .qc) as .fbx
